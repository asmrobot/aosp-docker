  cat <<USAGE
Usage: $0 <command>
Commands:
  checkout-branch <branch> [sync-options]
    Required volumes:
      /aosp       aosp
    Checks out a specific branch from /mirror into /aosp.
  build-all <target> [make-options]
    Required volumes:
      /aosp       For the AOSP branch checkout (see checkout-branch)
    Builds everything in the /aosp source tree for <target> (use
    \`source build/envsetup.sh && lunch\` to check for available targets,
    which may change between SDK levels).
  build <target> <local-module> [make-options]
    Required volumes:
      /app        For your app code (i.e. an Android.mk containing folder)
      /aosp       For the AOSP branch checkout (see checkout-branch)
      /artifacts  For build artifacts
    Builds <local-module> for <target> (see \`lunch\`) after copying /app
    to /aosp/external/MY_<local-module>. <local-module> must not conflict
    with with any built-in project or your module will not build. The
    prefix is added so that even if you accidentally do use a built-in
    name, at the very least you won't overwrite the files. Note that
    <local-module> must match the LOCAL_MODULE value in your Android.mk
    exactly. You will also need to set \`LOCAL_MODULE_TAGS := optional\` in
    your Android.mk because the build system requires it.
    After a successful build any produced shared/static libraries
    and executables are copied to /artifacts.
    The first build may take a very, very long time as many dependencies
    may have to be built before <local-module>.
    You should use the 'jdk6' tag for Android 4.4 and lower. For newer
    versions you have to use the 'jdk7' tag.
